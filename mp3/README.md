I just done zee how a whirled at makes us one derfle dings cootbee bad.

Look a dis tuff
Isn't it neet? wooden ewe thing mike elections complete?
wooden you thing mime the girl
The girl who has everystring?
lucah distro
tree-surgeons told
Who many 1-dars can one tavern hole?
Look in around here you'd stink
Shh Hersheys got everything
I've got cadge its and gilmoes a-twenty
I got whose zits and what zits galore
You want think about bobs?
I've got twenty!
Butt hoo kerr's?
know big deal
I want moors
I wanna beware the people are
I wanna siwanna see him dance sin
Stumbling a round on doze, whaddyacallem?
o'Fite
filipine your fans, don't get too far
Laser required for chumping, damn sting
rolling along down a, what's that word a gain?
Straight!
Up where they wall, up where they rum
Up where they tall all day and then some
wander in, free, with shy Colby
Party Dat whirlled.

what wood die give it eye cold live out of teasewaters
what tood I play to spend all the worsm in the sand?
Bet chonland they under stand
But they don't heavy-hand their dotters.
blight young winning sick of slimmin
Red E two stand
and red E 2 no wot the purple no
Ashen my questions and get some antlers
what a friar why does it, what's the word?
Burn?
Wins it's my tern
wooden eye lovel lovel two-X ploredasher up above?
Rout of the see
Fish I could bee
partidat whirled.
